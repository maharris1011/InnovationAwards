						<p>In partnership with various Ohio companies, CAR is playing a major role in supporting the commercialization of electronic power converters (Vanner), battery thermal management (Graftech), and engine exhaust sensors (Stoneridge). These activities involve multiple faculty and research staff in the center, and have each received funding from the Ohio Third Frontier program. CAR also has a history of engaging industry in research consortia; some 30 companies are currently paying members in one of the two consortia managed by CAR.</p>
						<p>CAR has served as an incubator for two companies that are currently housed at TechColumbus: PlugSmart and CAR Technologies LLC. In the case of PlugSmart, the center provided technical support and facilities in the form of engineering services to allow the company to strengthen its product portfolio. CAR Technologies LLC was created to translate advanced battery aging and characterization technology developed at OSU CAR.</p>

						<p>Boxgroove.com is the first parameter driven yield utilization aggregator software for the private club industry. Boxgroove is bringing to the masses an opportunity to experience a private club’s luxury even though one may not be a member. No company has bridged this space with a self service site that welcomes everyone to participate. Most companies that have tried to implement a solution for this industry used a traditional call center and required one’s club to validate who you are. So you had to already “be” a member in order to participate at these existing companies. Boxgroove provides a new marketing channel for private clubs to acquire members utilizing the marketing principles of the ”endowment effect”. Boxgroove can now help clubs increase their exposure and prospective lead opportunity while maintaining their brand and control to the club.</p>

						<p>Expedient Communications offers a wide range of managed hosting services such as virtualization, cloud computing, remote backups, management of equipment, storage area networks and more. These proven managed services combined with their eight top tier data centers enables Expedient to deliver premium colocation, network and managed services solutions to commercial, education and government entities. This blend of services, all under one roof, and the scale of the organization really sets Expedient apart from the competition. It enables them to have a complete view of their clients’ technical environment and makes Expedient accountable for ensuring that their customers’ systems will interact properly and have 100% uptime.</p>
						<p>During 2011, Expedient opened the most hardened commercially available data center in central Ohio. With the addition of this facility, companies in this region now have access to a single source provider for their primary computing and disaster recovery services. Previously they would have needed to work with multiple companies which can creates gaps in accountability or they would need to move their systems outside of the region. In two words Expedient provides DATA AVAILABILITY.</p>

						<p>JointVue is poised to revolutionize care for patients with painful joint conditions by providing highly efficient, user-friendly products that will address a $300 million annual business opportunity. The company recently raised $1.25 million from external angel investors and is currently in the process of launching clinical trials of its flagship product, JointGuide, a state-of-the-art 3-D injection guidance tool that couples traditional ultrasound with proprietary imaging software. The creation of 3-D joint images and real-time guided joint injection represent major commercial opportunities for this medical imaging product company. In addition, the company is in advanced discussions with federal research sponsors and major strategic partners in their market. The company’s founders, industry-recognized thought leaders in orthopedic research and clinical practice, have nine patent applications pending to cover the JointVue technology platform. Their ultrasound-based imaging products provide high-resolution, real-time imaging to the physician’s office, eliminating the expense and hazards of radiation-based imaging techniques that are the current standard of care.</p>

						<p>Founded in 1976, M/I Homes is one of nation’s leading builders of single family homes. M/I has established an exemplary reputation based on a strong commitment to superior customer service, innovative design, quality construction and premium locations. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, M/I Homes serves a broad segment of the housing market including first-time, move-up, luxury and empty nester buyers.</p>
						<p>The Technology team at M/I has had to endure a downsizing that has trimmed the team by more than 50 percent. In spite of the significant reductions, the team has been able to replace and integrate all of the core homebuilding systems within the company over the past 6 years. This has led to significant productivity gains throughout the company at a time when it was needed the most. Most recently, the team has built a mobile website, added an email customer care and marketing system to the existing CRM system, performed a full upgrade of the existing ERP and CRM systems and added two new divisions to the company (one via acquisition).</p>

						<p>Nationwide is one of the largest insurance and financial services companies in the world, focusing on domestic property and casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement savings, asset management, and strategic investments. As Nationwide has grown, the challenge of providing on your side service to our community has demanded more efficient and available infrastructure systems. </p>
						<p>The purpose of this nomination is to highlight success of the Continuous Service Improvement (CSI) program instituted by the Mainframe and Linux Systems Architecture, Engineering and Operations teams led by Brad Tussing, AVP IT Engineering; Bob Costanzo, AVP IT Engineering and Brian Callaghan, Director IT Architecture. </p>
						<p>The CSI program aligned hundreds of technology associates on technology strategy and over 120 service improvement initiatives with significant focus on improving shared systems availability. By targeting high risk infrastructure, the team reduced YoY high impacting system outages by 95%; average time to restore service by 90%; and change failure rate by 100%. This meant that customers impacted by heavy storm damage in 2011 were met with available systems and on your side service.</p>

It is essential that those applications are available and functioning properly in order to fulfill our promise. The problem statement provided to the team included minimizing the disruption of IT failures to our end users, while establishing monitoring solutions that allow internal IT resources to react to failures in a more efficient manner. Nationwide is the first company to integrate the Tealeaf tool with HP Service Center to automatically detect and alert from customer web sessions covering a majority of previously undetectable failures. Nationwide was able to custom develop a data feed to allow a single proactive view of mainframe and distributed message queue health metrics. During 2011, these solutions have helped prevent or limit major business impacts to our end users in 31 instances.</p>

With 90% percent of its desktops at the end of their five-year lifecycle, the DODD Infrastructure team was tasked with leveraging the massive benefits already realized through virtualizing the agency’s servers with VMware vSphere by virtualizing 1,500 desktops (nearly all of its users) with a program that would simplify management, deliver all needed applications to a diverse employee population, speed provisioning to associates in 10 developmental centers across the state, and increase privacy and security. DODD’s deployment of VMware’s View virtual desktop software is one of the largest known state and local government roll-outs in the U.S. according to Brian Feller, VP of sales and operations at WhipTail.</p>

						<p>The OhioHealth Information Services department is a team of more than 350 people who support the corporate enterprise care sites, physician practices and business areas. There are several factors that set them apart. First, the team is part of a changing environment that embraces mobile technologies, patient engagement and experiences, clinical quality and altered workflows in both the inpatient and outpatient areas of healthcare. Second, the size of the department provides associates with the opportunity to apply their skills to the development and support of IT solutions. While many of the IT associates are technically trained, others are clinically trained and have migrated into IT professionally. And finally, the team is passionate about service excellence. After adopting a best-practice Information Technology Infrastructure Library approach five years ago, the department has increased its competence in many process areas, as well as in customer service skills. The team’s work on the Mobile Mammography and Bone Density Project clearly demonstrates how these attributes are successfully applied to a real-life situation.</p>

						<p>The Wright Center of Innovation in Biomedical Imaging (WCI-BMI) at OSU has teamed up with The Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC) Center for Neuromodulation to simultaneously and synergistically leap forward existing neuroimaging and neuromodulation / deep brain stimulation technology. Together they seek to develop, pursue and validate the most innovative, minimally invasive, neurosurgical procedures to create advanced or new treatments for otherwise incurable ailments. Neuromodulation / deep brain stimulation requires not only exceptional neurosurgical skills and experience, but critically depends on non-invasive imaging to identify, map and visualize ultra-detailed neuro-anatomy, neuro-function and neuro-connectivity as well as non-invasive techniques to guide the fine-tuning of the modulation techniques. For leading edge technology teams to work and develop in highly interactive, well-known yet cocooned environments, bringing different technology efforts together, requires a common cause and goal. This is the common thread throughout the teams: advancing technology to help improve patient’s lives through breakthrough technologies. Within the last year, the integrated and well aligned team has broken through many perceived technology constraints in imaging technologies and leaped capabilities to advance therapeutic options.</p>
