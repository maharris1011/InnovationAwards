						<p>Consumption of fruits and vegetables is linked to lower incidence of chronic diseases. Therefore, there is great interest to determine what compounds in fruits and vegetables are responsible for those beneficial effects. Anthocyanins are the natural pigments responsible for most of the orange to red to blue to purple colors in nature. These compounds are potent antioxidants and are widely distributed in nature. They are believed to play an important role on the health-enhancing properties of fruits and vegetables. However, it is difficult to know for sure as they usually coexist with many other compounds, and isolating them into pure forms makes them extremely expensive. This candidate led the development of a novel isolation technique using solid phase extraction and a unique combination of solvents to achieve highly purified anthocyanin mixtures at low costs and high efficiency. A company: AnthoScyantific has been created to apply this technology for the production of large volumes of nature’s purest and most colorful antioxidants. For the first time, large scale in vivo studies of biological activity of these compounds will be possible.</p>

						<p>BringShare is an Internet-based tool designed to help marketing professionals, entrepreneurs and businesses measure and evaluate their online marketing investments more efficiently and cost-effectively. It is unique because it compiles online marketing initiatives -- website analytics, SEO, social media, email marketing, paid search -- into a single, easy-to-comprehend dashboard. BringShare presents data in a way that makes it simple to identify which efforts provide the best return on investment, which approaches need to be modified, and initiatives that aren’t paying off. </p>
						<p>Created by co-founders Danielle Walton and Justin Spring, BringShare streamlines and answers the challenges associated with generating and explaining marketing data reports. Because BringShare was created by experienced marketers for people leveraging online marketing strategies, there is a keen understanding of what data reports are critical versus data that is just nice to know. BringShare allows marketers to produce exceptional reports in a fraction of the time and expense it would take someone to create manually. In September 2011, BringShare became the first Ohio company invited to Silicon Valley to present at DEMO the launchpad for emerging technologies.</p>
