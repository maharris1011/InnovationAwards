						<p>Site Inspector is an iPad app developed to allow Facilities Managers to do building inspections of HVAC equipment, fire suppression systems, data centers and other critical platforms required to support thousands of JPMC buildings across the globe. It replaced unusable tablet PCs with spreadsheet-based forms with a touch screen app equipped with floor map graphics, system and part inventories, and real-time connections to maintenance systems and vendors. It’s implementation immediately removed two-days of lag between the identification of failing fire suppression system or chiller and the work required to bring it back to spec. It will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy costs annually and improve safety. The app required no end-user training and improved the productivity of the Facility Managers by 10-15% across the board.</p>

							<p>The Wright Center of Innovation in Biomedical Imaging (WCI-BMI) is a non-profit research enterprise organized under The Ohio State University Research Foundation to create an innovative academia/Ohio industry interface to develop, validate and perform services using leading-edge imaging technologies. Since its initiation through funding under the Ohio Third Frontier framework, it has helped create multiple imaging technologies that have been successfully commercialized by Ohio-based companies. The WCI-BMI also serves as the lead organization of the Ohio Imaging Research and Innovation Network (OIRAIN) that has created a new service delivery solution enabling the capability of state-of-the-art positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, not only at The Ohio State University campus, but now available throughout the State of Ohio via mobile services. Within the qualification timeframe, the WCI-BMI teamed up with Battelle Health and Life Sciences (Columbus, OH), also a non-profit organization, as well as Medpace (Cincinnati, OH), a for-profit CRO, to perform innovative preclinical and clinical trials for Ohio companies using newly available imaging technology that is commercially developed and manufactured by Philips Healthcare in Cleveland, OH.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="story">
						<p>Owens Corning (OC) is a world leader in building materials systems and composite solutions. Our products range from insulation and roofing used in residential, commercial and industrial applications, to glass fiber for reinforced composite materials used in transportation, electronics, marine, wind energy and other high-performance markets. OC extruded polystyrene (XPS) FOAMULAR products are produced by extruding polystyrene resins and additives with a blowing agent (BA) into insulating board product. OC used to use hydrochlorofluro carbon HCFC-142b (CH3 CF2Cl) as the BA. This molecule is an ozone depleting agent (ODP = 0.06), with high global warming potential (GWP = 2310, carbon dioxide = 1). OC successfully converted all foam manufacturing lines across the United States and Canada (all 4 plants) to a more environmentally friendly BA, 2009 - 2011. The new BA not only has zero ODP, but carries a combined GWP of 780. This is a 70% reduction in GWP from the base line. The zero-ozone-depleting formula is a significant improvement in the global warming potential than the previous system -- a level unmatched by competition.</p>

					<div class="story">
						<p>Under the leadership of Jeff Spitzner, President, Co-Founder, and Chief Science Officer, Rescentris has become a leading global provider of enterprise Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) software solutions for R&amp;D organizations. 90% of scientists developing the next generation of inventions, discoveries, and new products for research organizations still use paper lab notebooks. Productivity and collaboration are limited because data and Intellectual Property are scattered across paper and computer file systems and unsearchable.</p>
						<p>Over 100 sites in commercial, academic, government and nonprofit research labs in biology and multidiscipline research now utilize Rescentris’ award-winning product CERF to achieve efficient, paperless laboratories. ELNs are a rapidly growing segment of the $17 Billion lab informatics market. As product visionary, Spitzner guided development of CERF’s unique platform, including semantic technologies, mobility and SaaS options, and innovative user interfaces and tools to win competitive deals. In 2011, Dr. Spitzner expanded Rescentris’ management team, raised new equity funding, and boosted sales revenues. Jeff received his Ph.D. from Ohio State and post-doctoral research at MIT. He has co-founded five technology companies and is a recognized worldwide technology leader.</p>

						<p>e-Cycle empowers businesses and organizations to take a more responsible, secure and profitable approach to wireless recycling. Founded in 2005 by Christopher and Tonia Irion, e-Cycle was established on three guiding passions: a love of technology, environmental protection and charitable giving. </p>
						<p>e-Cycle collects wireless devices from businesses, reimbursing them for devices that retain value and recycling all others at no charge through an ISO Certified, EPA-registered facility. e-Cycle has a strict zero landfill policy. The information on every phone is either deleted or destroyed through the industry’s most rigorous data security measures. Once the data is completely scrubbed, e-Cycle resells the devices overseas where the used technologies are greatly needed. e-Cycle was recently ranked the #5 fastest growing, privately-held environmental services company in the U.S. by Inc. magazine, and the #3 fastest growing, privately-held company in Central Ohio in the Business First Fast 50. CEO Christopher Irion recently won the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Cleantech category for the South Central Ohio and Kentucky Region, and was recently honored at the national awards ceremony.</p>

						<p>OCLC is a global library cooperative dedicated to furthering access to the world’s information and reducing library costs. The economic environment has negatively impacted library budgets while increasing the demand for library services. Library funders, leaders, and staff are continually balancing available resources to meet the needs of their communities. Behind the scenes, the systems that support the work of a library selecting, acquiring, describing, and delivering collection materials are largely based on decades-old technology running on local servers. OCLC’s integrated Webscale Management Services introduces a cloud-based system with unified and simplified workflows for these mission-critical back office activities of the library. WMS facilitates sharing of infrastructure costs and resources. Libraries can also share data, applications and workflow improvements with peer institutions, end users and partners. For patrons, the world’s libraries’ collective catalogs become visible on the Web through search engines and via their preferred access points. Over 150 libraries worldwide have selected WMS, and it is already in use in over 30 libraries serving 95 branch locations.</p>

						<p>Consumption of fruits and vegetables is linked to lower incidence of chronic diseases. Therefore, there is great interest to determine what compounds in fruits and vegetables are responsible for those beneficial effects. Anthocyanins are the natural pigments responsible for most of the orange to red to blue to purple colors in nature. These compounds are potent antioxidants and are widely distributed in nature. They are believed to play an important role on the health-enhancing properties of fruits and vegetables. However, it is difficult to know for sure as they usually coexist with many other compounds, and isolating them into pure forms makes them extremely expensive. This candidate led the development of a novel isolation technique using solid phase extraction and a unique combination of solvents to achieve highly purified anthocyanin mixtures at low costs and high efficiency. A company: AnthoScyantific has been created to apply this technology for the production of large volumes of nature’s purest and most colorful antioxidants. For the first time, large scale in vivo studies of biological activity of these compounds will be possible.</p>

						<p>The patented Petaka bioreactor is the only cell culture device on the market today that enables cell culture without added carbon dioxide or humidity, because its engineered design conserves moisture, and optimizes oxygen and carbon dioxide transport between the cell culture and the outside atmosphere. This replication of natural growth conditions as seen in living bodies produces cells that are more natural and more active than seen with previous techniques, and creates at least a 30% reduction in laboratory costs.</p>
						<p>The Petaka bioreactor is both gravity-independent, that is, it can be turned in any direction without spillage or cell damage; and is capable of cell preservation at room temperatures for long periods of time. These features allow laboratories using the Petaka bioreactors to ship cells, without any special handling required, to users around the world.</p>
