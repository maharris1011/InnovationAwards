						<p>Duncan Dental Lab fabricates dental appliances. For some items, the techniques are over 40 years old compared to more modern day techniques. Duncan Dental Lab has not only thought of better ways , but we have too acquired a patent for our new innovations. Our innovation is a better way to precisely drill and place dental implants into a patient’s jaw bone. We invented a surgical technique measuring the width, depth of a patient’s jaw bone. We created a surgical guide with patented parts that will guide a predrill, in order to drill the exact spot that the implant will be placed without any lateral movement of the drill. After predrilling, our innovation will then guide final drilling at the correct depth. Also, with our technique, in addition to precise drilling we can immediately place the final restoration after surgery.</p>

						<p>Our Synthetic Nanofiber Trachea implant was developed at the request of surgeons from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. This implant was first used in a human in November, 2011 helping to save and extend a terminally ill patient’s life. This surgery was only the second instance of a synthetic trachea replacement in a human. Further human trials are in progress with the surgeons from the Karolinska Institutet. Additionally, we are now using the skills and techniques developed to create a new version of the Synthetic Nanofiber Trachea targeting the small dog market. Working with surgeons and researchers at the Ohio State University School of Veterinary Medicine we hope to implant this life-saving new product within a few months. </p>

						<p>The laboratory of Dr Baiocchi at The Ohio State University’s Comprehensive Cancer Center focuses on discovering novel strategies to prevent and treat cancer. His team is presently developing a vaccine to boost immunity to the Epstein-Barr virus to prevent malignant diseases such as lymphoma as well as benign conditions like infectious mononucleosis. To enhance this vaccine, several immune adjuvant strategies are being developed in parallel. Dr Baiocchi also leads a team of investigators who have discovered a novel class of drug that inhibits the PRMT5 enzyme, a protein that is dysregulated in diseases including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), lung cancer and lymphomas. New small-molecule compounds have shown great promise in blocking PRMT5 activity leading solid and blood cancer cells to restore important regulatory networks, decreased growth, cell death, and production of immune-modulating hormones that can induce anti-tumor immunity. While this new class of drug is currently being tested in preclinical cancer models (brain tumors: GBM, lymphoma), it is Dr Baiocchi’s goal to translate this drug into the clinic to improve treatment options of patients with cancer.</p>

						<p>Research efforts in the Finer Laboratory of The Ohio State University have focused on genetic transformation and transgene expression in crop plants. Although the main emphasis in the laboratory is currently on production and evaluation of transgenic soybean and sunflower, the laboratory has additional experience with wheat, maize, tomato, bentgrass, cotton, white pine, Chinese yam, Christmas cactus and Ohio buckeye. We were the first university laboratory to report consistent recovery of transgenic plants of cotton, soybean and corn. Embryogenic tissues are used for both basic studies on plant growth and development and as targets for transformation. In the area of gene expression, we are developing automated image capture and analysis for promoter evaluation using the green fluorescent protein. Images, collected over time, are both quantitatively analyzed for gene expression and used to generate time-lapse animations of tissue growth and gene expression. The animations reveal unique features of the subject materials, which are clearly not visible from single time point image collections. An automated image collection and analysis system is currently being considered for commercialization with industrial partners.</p>

						<p>Dr. Yebo Li is an assistant professor in the Department of Food, Agricultural, and Biological Engineering at The Ohio State University. Dr. Li has developed a successful research and extension program in bioproducts and bioenergy. He has developed a novel technology for the production of polyurethane foam from renewable source to be used in a variety of products including automotive seats, headrests, and bumpers; sealants and thermal insulation systems for refrigerators; insulation boards; and packaging materials. The product, known as biopolylols, is made from crude glycerin, a byproduct of biodiesel production that is considered waste and has little commercial value. When mixed with biomass through a patented process that he developed, the crude glycerin becomes the foundation for making the biopolyols and polyurethane foam. His product is comparable to petroleum-based foam in quality; however, his product is renewable and is less expensive to produce than petroleum-based foams. Dr. Li’s technology has been licensed to Poly-Green Technologies, a start-up company in Mansfield, Ohio, for commercial production.</p>

					<div class="story">
						<p>Since joining OSU, Dr. Sadee has developed a Program in Pharmacogenomics, aimed at discovery of genetic variations associated with disease risk and treatment outcomes, now funded by a $9 million NIH grant. Companion diagnostic biomarkers can optimize and individualize drug therapy, a central tenet of the emerging era of personalized medicine. With novel genomics methodologies, we have identified several frequent genetic variants in key candidate genes with strong clinical effects, showing potential as companion diagnostics (patent applications are pending), while clinical applications have already begun. Drug-companion diagnostics (”theranostics”) are still in infancy but considered a main future direction of medicine; indeed, a companion diagnostic may equal the value of a new drug entity. In separate studies, he has developed neutral opioid antagonists for treatment of opioid side effects and abuse liability. Secured by strong patent backing, the first drug candidate has passed through Phase I clinical trials with promising results (supported by AIKO Biotechnology). With ~200 million opioid analgesic prescriptions per year, substantially improved analgesic preparations have enormous clinical utility and market potential.</p>
