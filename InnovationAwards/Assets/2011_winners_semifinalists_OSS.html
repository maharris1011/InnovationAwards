						<p>e-Cycle empowers businesses and organizations to take a more responsible, secure and profitable approach to wireless recycling. Founded in 2005 by Christopher and Tonia Irion, e-Cycle was established on three guiding passions: a love of technology, environmental protection and charitable giving. </p>
						<p>e-Cycle collects wireless devices from businesses, reimbursing them for devices that retain value and recycling all others at no charge through an ISO Certified, EPA-registered facility. e-Cycle has a strict zero landfill policy. The information on every phone is either deleted or destroyed through the industry’s most rigorous data security measures. Once the data is completely scrubbed, e-Cycle resells the devices overseas where the used technologies are greatly needed. e-Cycle was recently ranked the #5 fastest growing, privately-held environmental services company in the U.S. by Inc. magazine, and the #3 fastest growing, privately-held company in Central Ohio in the Business First Fast 50. CEO Christopher Irion recently won the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Cleantech category for the South Central Ohio and Kentucky Region, and was recently honored at the national awards ceremony.</p>

						<p>PTS Physicians primarily produces high quality benchmarks for hospital-owned physician practices. Anticipating changes in healthcare delivery in the U.S., several hospitals have acquired physician practices to be able to provide a continuum of care. A major problem faced by hospital administrators is the absence of trustworthy benchmarks to assess the performance of physician practices.</p>
						<p>The benchmarking market is dominated by MGMA and AMGA, both of which collect self-reported summary data from physician practices, aggregate the data, and generate benchmarks for distribution. Several concerns about the validity of these benchmark data, their timeliness, and their stability over time have been expressed. PTS developed a process by which transaction level data are collected, cleaned, standardized, and used to generate benchmarks. The superiority of these benchmarks has been noticed by various hospitals and industry partners, which enabled us to sign up over 500 hospital-owned practices last year. PTS is also developing a major application which integrates physician data with hospital data, thus enabling further analysis to isolate the drivers of quality of care. PTS qualifies under the Business Approach category.</p>

						<p>WorthPoint is the leading online resource for collectible enthusiasts. It provides the deepest, broadest reference data set available for art, antiques and collectibles worldwide. Before WorthPoint was established, there was no single place online to help people value, preserve, buy and sell items.</p>
						<p>Described as the “Bloomberg” of the industry, WorthPoint provides a vast database of sales records aggregated from eBay, virtual marketplaces and leading auction houses worldwide. It’s called Worthopedia and includes more than 100 million auction sales results. In addition, WorthPoint offers articles written by subject-matter experts called Worthologists, who also provide item valuations through the Ask-A-Worthologist service.During the qualification period for this award, WorthPoint achieved several successes: its paid subscriber base increased by 80% to 18,000, the data in Worthopedia doubled to more than 100 million auction sales results and revenue doubled. WorthPoint’s innovation also translates into success for its subscribers. When a woman found a painting in a trashcan, she turned to WorthPoint. After discovering it was truly a treasure, she sold it at Sotheby?s for $103,000. WorthPoint helps people discover their hidden wealth.</p>
