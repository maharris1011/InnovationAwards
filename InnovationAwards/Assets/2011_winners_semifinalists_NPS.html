							<p>The Wright Center of Innovation in Biomedical Imaging (WCI-BMI) is a non-profit research enterprise organized under The Ohio State University Research Foundation to create an innovative academia/Ohio industry interface to develop, validate and perform services using leading-edge imaging technologies. Since its initiation through funding under the Ohio Third Frontier framework, it has helped create multiple imaging technologies that have been successfully commercialized by Ohio-based companies. The WCI-BMI also serves as the lead organization of the Ohio Imaging Research and Innovation Network (OIRAIN) that has created a new service delivery solution enabling the capability of state-of-the-art positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, not only at The Ohio State University campus, but now available throughout the State of Ohio via mobile services. Within the qualification timeframe, the WCI-BMI teamed up with Battelle Health and Life Sciences (Columbus, OH), also a non-profit organization, as well as Medpace (Cincinnati, OH), a for-profit CRO, to perform innovative preclinical and clinical trials for Ohio companies using newly available imaging technology that is commercially developed and manufactured by Philips Healthcare in Cleveland, OH.</p>

						<p>The Ohio State University Medical Center is transforming healthcare delivery from its current reactive mode of sick care, to a more proactive one that makes health care more predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory. This novel approach is called P4 Medicine. The future of medicine focuses on creating systems and processes to deliver key evidence-based practices and to stratify individuals into smaller precise populations to deliver these key interventions. The goal of P4 Medicine is to reduce healthcare costs, improve outcomes and deliver higher quality health care for patients. It embraces the interface between an individual’s unique DNA, environment and behavior to choose the right intervention at the right time for the right person. P4 Medicine utilizes advances in genomics and molecular diagnostics discoveries to provide predictive information that is necessary to tailor, or personalize, disease management approaches for each individual. Ohio State’s Medical Center is pioneering the advancement of P4 Medicine and is committed to improving people’s lives.</p>

						<p>The Columbus Museum of Art (CMA) has been a vibrant centerpiece of the Columbus community for over 130 years, providing creative and thought-provoking experiences for over 200,000 onsite and 400,000 unique, online visitors annually. CMA houses over 10,500 works of art, including an internationally recognized collection of European and American Modernism. The Howald, Sirak, Schumacher, Schiller, and Photo League collections are widely respected and provide inspiration for exhibitions and programs.</p>
						<p>On January 1, 2011, CMA unveiled the historic Elizabeth M. and Richard M. Ross Building and Center for Creativity following a fifteen-month renovation. The Center is over 18,000 square feet dedicated to experiences that foster creativity, imagination, critical thinking, and innovation; key skills for success in the 21st century. Distinct spaces include an Innovation Lab, designed as a “black box” studio for video and audio recording, a state-of-the-art Auditorium with HD recording/streaming equipment, and Wonder Room that incorporates works of art to inspire families to explore art together. We have packed forward-thinking technology and innovative thinking into these spaces to offer an array of programs for lifelong learning.</p>

					<p>The City of Columbus, Ohio is one the the best places to live, work and raise a family. Mayor Michael B. Coleman, elected officials and employees of the city government work everyday to maintain that high standard of service and quality of life for all Columbus residents, to keep Columbus neighborhoods vibrant, and to support the economic development of the entire Central Ohio region.</p>
					<p>MyColumbus encompasses four mayoral initiatives to help city residents: My Neighborhood, Get Active, Green Spot, and 311. The My Neighborhood campaign allows residents to easily select and map government buildings, local entertainment and retail venues, as well as other useful Columbus sites. The Get Active initiative enables residents to access an events calendar, park and trail guides and tips from prominent community members on healthy eating and exercise. The GreenSpot initiative encourages sustainable behavior with environmental facts and pointers. The app also includes a 311 submission section where residents can submit service requests from their mobile devices. Currently the application is available for iOS and Droid users.</p>

						<p>Columbus State Community College (CSCC) was founded in downtown Columbus in 1963 and currently serves more than 30,000 students in the regional metropolitan area through two campuses and nine off-campus centers. Offering 200-plus degree and certificate programs as well as continuing education and workforce development opportunities, CSCC has emerged as the state leader in Ohio for online learning enrollment.</p>
						<p>To help support its online learning efforts, CSCC’s Instructional Technologies and Distance Learning (ITDL) division is implementing a campus-wide initiative to unify and automate its lecture capture and streaming video delivery processes. Working with CSCC faculty and two primary vendors -- TechSmith and its turnkey Camtasia Relay desktop recording system, plus Kaltura and its online Content Distribution Network video platform -- ITDL has developed a streamlined, easy-to-use solution for faculty to capture and publish presentations throughout the campus. The result is an intuitive system that allows for virtually universal creation and delivery of educational content -- anywhere, anytime, by anybody, and to any device.</p>

						<p>Recycling makes a positive contribution to the global conservation of energy and it is important for social, economic, and environmental reasons. Though many recycling programs are available in cities, there is always a gap in public awareness on how to best use the recycling programs. One way to close this gap is to continue to promote awareness of recycling in the public. Four years ago, I started an effort to spread awareness about the dangers of e-waste. I found out many companies that offer recycling-options for electronics aren’t free. If households know how they can reach local recyclable organizations, charities, and the impact of e-waste, many electronics items would have been saved. We offered a free service to collect old computers to recycle or, if possible, to fix any minor-issues and donate them to local charities. So far we safely diverted nearly 50,000lbs of e-waste for proper recycling. What was a small effort is now a legitimate non-profit 501(c)(3) public charity. Our goal is to expand this project concept to many schools, nearby cities, and encourage more children to participate.</p>

						<p>Connect Ohio has implemented a statewide broadband training program, Every Citizen Online (ECO), in order to increase sustainable broadband adoption in Ohio. The project provides free computer training sessions at public libraries, community colleges, community organizations, and educational centers throughout Ohio and teaches new users how to access the Internet and how to best utilize all the Internet has to offer.</p>
						<p>The goal of the project is to showcase the many educational, healthcare, economic, and communication benefits of broadband use, and to encourage adoption by residents statewide. Since the program’s launch in late December, 247 locations are offering the ECO program and more than 11,000 Ohio adults have taken advantage of the free basic computer training.</p>

						<p>North South Foundation is a non-profit, all-volunteer driven organization. The Columbus chapter, founded in 2002, provides educational resources and encourages excellence in education for children. Our services mainly include: a) We conduct educational contests once a year for the children from K-12. Contests include spelling,vocabulary, math, science, geography, essay writing and public speaking. b) We started NSF preparation clubs last year to provide free tutoring services in the subjects of spelling, math, science, essay, public speaking, and geography. c) We provide scholarships ($250 each) for needy children in India for college education. These educational contests, workshops, and preparation-clubs are designed to encourage excellence among the Indian-American children and prepare them to enter into better colleges. Nearly 400 children are taking advantage of Columbus chapter services. Nearly 40 parent teachers are helping to run the weekly classes in three different locations including Bharatiya-Hindu-Temple, Sai-Temple, and New Albany Library. We are progressing every year as more volunteers join NSF, more donors’ make contributions, more children participate in the contests, and we are able to provide more scholarships to needy students in India.</p>

						<p>The Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities (DODD) has oversight for over 90,000 individuals served by county boards of developmental disabilities. Additionally, DODD is directly responsible for administering Medicaid waivers to provide service and support to over 25,000 individuals. This service delivery represents over $1 billion in Medicaid claims annually. </p>
						<p>DODD set out to improve its online access to information and services focusing on the entire landscape of the way DODD was interacting with and conducting business with its stakeholders. In response to this challenge, DODD IT staff developed an integrated solution that delivered website content and game-changing electronic business processes as part of a new DODD portal. The website and portal developed using Microsoft SharePoint featured process improvements that benefited stakeholders. Key elements of the portal are: Provider certification wizard; Electronic provider fee payments; Compliance Monitoring (CMO); Document imaging; Workflow automation; Single signon; and Provider search. Underlying the portal are a number of changes to infrastructure including Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) with associated full implementation of the Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager (FIM).</p>

					<div class="story">
						<p>The Ohio Small Business Development Center at Columbus State Community College (SBDC) provides high end business consulting and training to small businesses throughout Central Ohio including Franklin and its eight contiguous counties. This is the only SBDC in the nation to offer all four centers: Core, Manufacturing and Technology, Latino and the International Trade Assistance Center, under one roof, providing small business owners with access to business development assistance that is unparalleled anywhere else in the country. </p>
						<p>In 2011, the SBDC looked for ways to serve a greater number of clients with its limited staff. The solution was to establish topic specific group sessions augmented by online live chat sessions. Through these sessions we are able to serve an average group of 15 in 9 hours verses 90 hours previously. This new delivery method reduced the time it took to get the business from inception to market entry for the client and dramatically increased the Center capacity to serve the greater district. Utilizing technology has also allowed the SBDC to reduce expenses initially resulting in an annual savings of $3060.00.</p>
