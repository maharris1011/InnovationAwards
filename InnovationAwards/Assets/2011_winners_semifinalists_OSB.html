						<p>BringShare is an Internet-based tool designed to help marketing professionals, entrepreneurs and businesses measure and evaluate their online marketing investments more efficiently and cost-effectively. It is unique because it compiles online marketing initiatives-website analytics, SEO, social media, email marketing, paid search-into a single, easy-to-comprehend dashboard. BringShare presents data in a way that makes it simple to identify which efforts provide the best return on investment, which approaches need to be modified, and initiatives that aren’t paying off.</p>
						<p>Created by co-founders Danielle Walton and Justin Spring, BringShare streamlines and answers the challenges associated with generating and explaining marketing data reports. Because BringShare was created by experienced marketers for people leveraging online marketing strategies, there is a keen understanding of what data reports are critical versus data that is just nice to know. BringShare affords marketers to produce exceptional reports in a fraction of the time and expense it would take someone to create manually. In September 2011, BringShare became the first Ohio company invited to Silicon Valley to present at DEMO-the launchpad for emerging technologies.</p>

						<p>CAR Technologies has commercialized a suite of testing, modeling and controls engineering services that allow major OEMs to validate the lifecycle operational and control strategies of their proposed hybrid/electric vehicle or large-scale stationary energy storage applications. </p>
						<p>Because of the unique know-how that is employed, very high-accuracy models allow for 1) better control and operation of the advanced battery system across a wider range of operation (e.g. very low states-of-charge, low temperatures), 2) flexible vocational modeling and simulation for systems architecture development and refinement, and 3) better decisions about aging for end-of-first-life decision-making, and 4) proactive ways to make decisions about battery re-use, second life application for large-scale energy storage, and recycling. CAR Technologies, with the help of the OSU Center for Automotive Research, designed, assembled and commissioned the largest testing and engineering center south of Detroit in less than six months. CAR Technologies is a tier 1 supplier to several major OEMs, profitable, and cashflow positive in its first year of operation.</p>

					<div class="story">
						<p>For many years, a broad base of stakeholders, including physicians, patients, employers, insurers, and hospitals, have touted the benefits to healthcare delivery if health information technology was widely adopted in hospitals and medical practices. The vision of a patient’s medical history being portable and easily accessible to various medical providers and in multiple care settings seemed like an obvious way to improve healthcare delivery and to control costs. Nonetheless, many hurdles blocked the realization of this vision for providers. The Central Ohio Health Information Exchange (COHIE), a non-profit organization, was established in April 2010 to help Primary Care Providers overcome the barriers to Electronic Health Record (EHR) adoption. Through funding provided by the Federal Government’s HITECH Act, COHIE has already served over 1,300 medical providers in the central Ohio area.</p>
						<p>COHIE has raised the bar of EHR adoption in central Ohio, which is arguably the most important step toward enhancing clinical decision making, improving overall quality of care and reducing healthcare-related costs. We have achieved great success. However, in the end, the true beneficiaries of COHIE’s work are patients.</p>

						<p>The Columbus Idea Foundry is a public facility for the technological, creative, entrepreneurial and educational communities in Central Ohio. We host conventional as well as digital design and fabrication resources (from welding, woodworking, and metal casting to CAD/CAM/CNC machining, 3D printing and laser cutting), offer affordable classes to the general public in the use of these tools, and then provide workshop access to members for a monthly fee and an hourly rate. We host rental studio and production space for 30+ individuals, small businesses, artists and innovators; perform micromanufacturing services for a number of businesses in Central Ohio and beyond; provide design/prototyping consultation; offer technology transfer services and educational outreach opportunities. In the last year, the Columbus Idea Foundry has expanded its brick-and-mortar workshop space ten fold (to 24,000 square feet), and Dr. Bandar’s novel social entrepreneurship business model has attracted the attention of representatives from Battelle, the Columbus Foundation, the Nation Science Foundation, the US FabLab Network, the Greater Columbus Arts Council, and other technological, entrepreneurial, educational and creative organizations.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="story">
						<p>EndoSphere is a medical technology company developing a platform of endoscopically implantable devices for the treatment of metabolic disorders including one of the world’s most critical healthcare issues: obesity. </p>
						<p>EndoSphere’s breakthrough innovation is the SatiSphere System, a small duodenal insert that uses the body’s natural physiology to regulate satiation mechanisms and slow digestion. Current procedures and devices for treating obesity primarily focus on food restriction (attempting to deter over-eating by restricting stomach capacity) or malabsorption (attempting to prevent absorption of ingested food as it passes through the digestive tract). </p>
						<p>The SatiSphere device takes a novel approach by improving the natural physiological mechanisms that regulate satiety and slow digestion. Delivered endoscopically to the proximal portion of the small intestine in a brief outpatient procedure, the SatiSphere device slows the passage of ingesta which enables the neurons lining the duodenal walls to detect ingested calories more effectively. These neurons trigger the release of hormones that regulate appetite and digestion. The result: patients experience an earlier feeling of fullness and extended feeling of satisfaction between meals, reducing their urge to over-eat.</p>

					<div class="story">
						<p>Fabrisonic is an Ohio start-up established to sell equipment and services related to the patented Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) process. UAM uses the power of sound to metallurgically bond layers of metal foil. The process produces true metallurgical bonds with full density and works with a variety of metals such as aluminum, copper, and stainless steel. In combining additive and subtractive process capabilities, UAM can create deep slots, hollow, latticed, or honeycombed internal structures, and complex geometries impossible with conventional subtractive manufacturing processes. Additionally, the solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for welding of dissimilar metals. This enables dissimilar metal cladding, production of custom metal matrix composites, and the ability to embed objects or sensors in a metal substrate. Through the use of UAM, customers will be able to manufacture complex parts that have unique features and attributes not possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. In addition, parts currently made with traditional operations can be made with less waste, an increasingly important factor as more expensive, higher performance materials see broader use.</p>

						<p>The Metropreneur was created by Walker and Anne Evans in August of 2010 with the sole purpose of strengthening the entrepreneurial environment in Central Ohio and to help support our small business community. We achieve that by providing breaking news and announcements, business profiles and spotlights, highlighting local and regional trends, providing advice columns from business professionals and a wide variety of other types of valuable and interactive content.</p>

					<div class="story">
						<p>As founder and president of The Spa Marketplace.com, Loren Stone’s inspiration came from over 17 years in the hospitality, spa and wellness industries. He envisioned something bigger, utilizing ecommerce to develop a marketplace for consumers, buyers and suppliers. A marketplace to forge relationships all the while remaining committed to a lifestyle of health, wellness and natural choices.</p>
						<p>It was imperative to develop an online community for the free flowing exchange of ideas and thoughts to shape these communities for the years to come. A goal was aligning the business with like-minded partners making a difference in the education of these lifestyles. The Spa Marketplace.com is designed for the consumer market and the spa/wellness professional. In addition, a home office, order processing, and fulfillment complex is located in Columbus, Ohio. In order to achieve our goals we maximized open source platforms, while integrating dynamic interfaces for education, sale of goods/services and the promotion of a healthy and wellness lifestyle. Our mission is to bring a product that is superior to the alternatives while penetrating international markets.</p>

						<p>Vantage Point Logistics, LLC (VPL) helps fund higher education’s future by putting money back into a university’s budget. The VPL program provides an easy way for universities to help offset the federal and state budget cuts that are affecting all schools, and driving up tuition costs. It is based on the fact that vendors are overcharging our universities on shipping costs for the items they are ordering every day. Through experience and technology, VPL converts those overcharges into savings of 35%, on average, which can be hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. With Vantage Point Logistics’ program in place, universities have to do very little to obtain those savings. Other industries have very successfully taken control of their freight costs, and now it is time for higher education to do the same with the Vantage Point Logistics freight program.</p>
