Innovation Awards Mobile App
============================

This is an application for the TechColumbus Innovation Awards 2012.  See the
[Sandlot Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/isandlot.com)  for more detail 
on what the app is about and how it works.

We want the users of this application to become *active participants* in the event throughout the year.   

We expect that they will share, comment, friend, post, compete, and otherwise promote the event as 
they become more engaged.  The goal of the application is to drive downloads and participation in the 
awards beyond the evening event.  

In the end, the attendees of the event need to feel that this application is:

>“An engaging way for attendees to socialize with the TechColumbus awards throughout the year.”

Contact Points are:
*  Mark Harris (development)
* David Harris (art/design)

* Alicia Oddi (features/owner)
